    "\n",
    "Many advanced machine learning and data analysis techniques are founded on the principles of regression. A solid understanding of regression is often essential for mastering more complex algorithms, such as logistic regression, polynomial regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso, linear kernels in SVM, and neural networks. In this first assignment, we will explore the fundamentals of regression to establish a strong foundation for a wide range of machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook consists the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [A: data preparation regression](#01)\n",
    "- [B: Implementation of the cost function algorithm](#02)\n",
    "- [C: Implementation of the gradient descent algorithm](#03)\n",
    "- [D: Implementation of a regularization parameter](#04)\n",
    "- [E: Data preparation logistic regression](#051)\n",
    "- [F: Implementation of logistic regression](#05)\n",

    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this two weeks you will be able to:\n",
    "- Understand the fundamental concepts of regression models.\n",
    "- Grasp the construction and significance of feature weights in modeling.\n",
    "- Understand model error, learning rates, and regularization factors and their impact on model performance.\n",
    "- Translate theoretical concepts into functional code, implementing machine learning models.\n",
    "- Articulate the appropriate use cases for different regression algorithms.\n",
    "- Build your own regression classes from scratch, implementing methods for fitting the model and making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "- Ensure you fully understand the requirements and objectives of the assignment.\n",
    "- If you need additional context or clarification, please check the provided videos or background literature.\n",
    "- Work through each part of the assignment methodically, ensuring all tasks are completed.\n",
    "- Using the code from the tasks A to E, create **python files** with a classes that models data using (logistic) regression. These classes should include the following methods:\n",
    "  - `fit()`: A method to fit the model to the training data, determining the best weights.\n",
    "  - `predict()`: A method to predict the outcome for new input data using the trained model.\n",
    "  - `predict_proba()`: (optional) returns an array with probability per class for the specific sample.\n",
    "- Submit a repository with a directory `regression` that includes:\n",
    "  - This finished notebook and supportive code snippets\n",
    "  - The python file with the regression class \n",
    "  - The python file with the logistic regression class\n",
    "  - The python file with the polynomial class (optional)\n",
    "  - An evaluation document that details specific scenarios or datasets where each type of regression (linear, logistic, polynomial) is appropriate or inappropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes:\n",
    "- Do not add datafiles to your repository. Repositories with datafiles will not be accepted\n",
    "- Class solutions should be delivered in python files. Not in notebooks\n",
    "- When AI tools are used, you must provide proper references and explanations for how they were utilized. Failure to do so will be considered as academic fraud\n",
    "- The bonus assignment (H) is not mandatory\n",
    "- Use PEP8 \n",
